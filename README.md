Hello! Thanks for checking out the repo for my latest portfolio website. I think I've grown quite a bit as a developer & designer in the past year, so I wanted to create something to showcase some of what I've learned and done.

## Getting Started

- `npm install`
- `npm start` to run dev server
- `npm build` from production

## What I used

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for my text-editor
- [Infinity Free](https://infinityfree.net/) for my personal Web Hosting
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for secondary hosting
- [React](https://reactjs.org) as a framework/library
- [React-Router-Dom](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) for stock photos
- And More

Let me know what you think!! ðŸ˜„
